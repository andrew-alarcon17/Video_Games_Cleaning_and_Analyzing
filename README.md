## Data Description:
This data set consists of video game sales by publisher, region, genre, rating, and developer, as well as their critic and user review scores.


## Project Summary:
For this project, I wanted to explore the sales of video games during the years between 1980 and 2016. More specifically, I was curious to see which publishers and developers performed the best in terms of sales, as well as what types of games were selling the most and in which regions.


## Data Analysis:
Just by looking at overall game sales throughout this time period, we can see that Nintendo beats out all the competition by a landslide.

But diving a little deeper, we can see just how these publishers performed in terms of game sales for each individual year. Nintendo still comes out on top for most years, sometimes losing to publishers like Sony and EA.

What about the genre of games? Which were the ones that performed the best during these years?

Action games tend to win people's hearts dating back since the early 2000's. Its quite interesting because that is around the time when video game consoles started introducing 3D visuals, a field where an action game could thrive in. It makes more sense for the 90's to have Platform type games to dominate a little more, given the 2D landscape nature of graphical limitations.

Looks like Sony dominated for 10 years with their consoles Playstation 1 and 2 in the years of 1995 to 2005. It wasn't until 2006 when Nintendo released the Wii which shook the landscape of gaming for quite some time. Let's compare the amount of games released and sold by Publishers in the following two charts.


Now how about the number of games made compared to the amount of games sold? Let's see below with the following two charts.

Based on these two charts, it looks as though Electronic Arts released the most games during these years, but that doesn't necessarily mean they sold the most. Nintendo comes out on top. Guess the saying quality over quantity is true after all. Keeping that in mind, let's look at the quality of these games by user and critic scores next.


Now, where do game sales perform the best?

Looks like North American sales dominated for nearly every year during 1980 to 2016.
